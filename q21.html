<!-- In how many ways can we position an HTML element? Or what are the permissible values of the position attribute?

There are mainly 7 values of position attribute that can be used to position an HTML element:

static: Default value. Here the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
absolute: Here the element is positioned relative to its parent element. The final position is determined by the values of left, right, top, bottom.
fixed: This is similar to absolute except here the elements are positioned relative to the <html> element.
relative: Here the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document and positioned relative to its original/ normal position.
initial: This resets the property to its default value.
inherit: Here the element inherits or takes the property of its parent. -->
