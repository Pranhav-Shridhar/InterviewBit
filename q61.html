<!-- What is the Geolocation API in HTML5?

Geolocation API is used to share the physical location of the client with websites. This helps in serving locale-based content and a unique experience to the user, based on their location. This works with a new property of the global navigator object and most of the modern browsers support this.

var geolocation = navigator.geolocation; -->
