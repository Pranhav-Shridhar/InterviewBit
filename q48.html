<!-- What is new about the relationship between the <header> and <h1> tags in HTML5?
    
    As HTML5 was all about better semantics and arrangements of the tags and elements, the <header> tag specifies the header section of the webpage. Unlike in previous version there was one <h1> element for the entire webpage, now this is the header for one section such as <article> or <section>. According to the HTML5 specification, each <header> element must at least have one <h1> tag.
