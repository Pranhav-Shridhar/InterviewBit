<!-- What are raster images and vector images?

Raster Images - The raster image is defined by the arrangement of pixels in a grid with exactly what color the pixel should be. Few raster file formats include PNG(.png), JPEG(.jpg), etc.
Vector Images - The vector image is defined using algorithms with shape and path definitions that can be used to render the image on-screen written in a similar markup fashion. The file extension is .svg
