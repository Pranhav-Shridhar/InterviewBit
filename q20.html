<!-- Is it possible to change an inline element into a block level element?

Yes, it is possible using the “display” property with its value as “block”, to change the inline element into a block-level element.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <p>
      This is an inline span
      <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span>
      element inside a paragraph.
    </p>

    <p>
      The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line
      and only takes up as much width as necessary.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
